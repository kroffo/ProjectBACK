ProjectBACK is a program written by Kenny Roffo.

The program is written to run a text-based game in which the player traverses rooms, finding treasure chests, doors, weapons, armors, keys and enemies.

Each distribution will come with only one such game. However, the program to run the game is written to be general.
The actual world in which the game takes place is independent of the programming.
The program covers all of the functionality, but the world in which the game takes place is constructed externally.
The world comes from an XML file, a text file that uses very specific syntax.
Due to this setup, an infinite number of worlds can be made and played using these rules all using this one program.

* GAMEPLAY *
************

The program contains several commands. Here is a list of commands with their descriptions.

	Help  	-- Displays this help message again.
	Quit  	-- Ends the game (Progress will not be saved). [Alt. Command - Exit]
	Room  	-- See all Characters, Chests, and Doors in the current room. [Alt. Command - Look]
	Bag   	-- Check the Weapons, Armors, and Keys in your personal Satchel. [Alt. Command - Satchel]
	Enter 	-- Move your character through a door to a neighboring room. [Alt. Command - Open]
	Status	-- Check the Health, ATK, DEF, Strength, Agility, Luck and win count of your character. [Alt. Command - Stats]
	Peek  	-- Peek through a door to see what's in a neighboring room.
	Unlock	-- Unlock a chest or door if you have the right key.
	Search	-- Search and take Items from a chest or fallen character. [Alt. Command - Loot]
	Equip 	-- Equip a Weapon or Armor from your personal satchel.
	Enemy	-- Check the Health, Strength and Weapon of an enemy without actually battling.
	Fight 	-- Choose a character which you will then fight to the death (Unless you flee). [Alt. Commands - Battle, Attack]
	
	
If you have the correct key to a locked chest or door, interacting with it will use the key to unlock it. (Enter, Peek, Search, etc.)
	
These commands are not case-sensitive, so PEEK, peek, and PeEk all will activate the command Peek.
There is one exception to this, which you will be reminded of when playing by the phrase "(Case-Sensitive)".
When entering the names of specific items (Weapons, armors or keys) or enemies, the names ARE case-sensitive.
Keeping this case-sensitive allows the world creator to include more challenges that are aimed at confusing the user,
such as the red, blue and green room challenge towards the beginning of the game, using keys, rather than names.

WINNING:
	To win the game the player must make his/her way to the Heaven Room.
	Upon entry through the door to the Heaven Room, the game will end in victory.

**********
* BATTLE *
**********

To enter a battle, use the "Fight" command. If you enter "Room" or "Look", you will see characters in a room.
The format looks like this:

	Human: Kenny
	
This means that this character is a Human, and his/her name is Kenny. So to battle this character,
when asked for a name after entering "Fight", you should enter "Kenny", rather than "Human: Kenny".
The name you should enter is always to the right of the colon.

During battle, some commands are unavailable, but new commands become of use. Here is the list of commands available during battle:

	Rules	-- Displays these rules for battling.
	Attack	-- Attack with your current weapon. Player and CPU attacks are simultaneous.
	Flee  	-- Escape the battle by entering a door. Player will take a hit by the enemy before fleeing.
	Dodge 	-- A successful dodge might cause the opponent to stumble. Success based on agility.
	Equip 	-- Allows the player to switch weapons, but at the expense of a turn of attack.
	Block 	-- Player prepares for an incoming attack, decreasing damage taken, possibly causing opponent to stumble.
	Room  	-- Prints the contents of the current room. (Does not use a turn)
	Status	-- Check the status of the enemy and yourself. (Does not use a turn)
	Bag   	-- Displays the Weapons, Armors, and Keys in your personal Satchel. (Does not use a turn)
		
Characters have Health, ATK, DEF, Block, Agility and Luck.
All of these come into play during battle. Below are more detailed descriptions of how each command executes.

Attack:
	A random number is generated from 1 to the character's ATK. The other characters DEF is then subtracted from this.
	At this point, if the damamge is less than 1, then it is reset to 1, so if a character attacks, it will never do
	less than 1 damage. Finally, before damage is inflicted, a random number is generated from 1-100.
	If this number is less than the character's luck, then the hit becomes critical, dealing double damage.
	
Flee:
	If the player is to enter a door that does not exist, then the game will let the player know, and no turn will pass.
	If the player tries to enter a locked door, and does not have the key, the player will not leave the room, but will take a hit.
	
Dodge:
	If the enemy is on the ground, then the program will inform the player, and no turn will pass.
	If the enemy is not on the ground, a random number is generated from 1-100. If this number is
	less than the player's agility, then the player will successfully dodge, and the enemy will fall to the ground.
	No damage will be taken if the dodge is successful, otherwise, damage will be taken as normal.
	
Eqiup:
	Allows the player to equip a weapon at the expense of 1 turn. (Equipping a weapon, unequips an already equpped weapon)
	Should the player not have the weapon entered, perhaps due to the fact that the name is case-sensitive, no turn will pass.

Block:
	A character may only block if a weapon is equipped. The success of a block is determined by generating a random number from 1-100.
	If this number is less than the ratio of player strength to enemy strength (x100) then the block is successful.
	No matter what, blocking will cut the damage taken. An unsuccessful block will cut the damage by the player's block.
	A successful block will cut the damage taken by twice the player's block, and also knock the enemy down.
	
Status: Displays the Health of the enemy, and the stats of the player.

Bag and Room commands are the same as when out of battle, and do not use a turn of battle.

Every turn, unless the enemy is on the ground, the enemy will attack. If the enemy is on the ground, it will get up that turn.

Once you win 5 battles, you will level up and all of your stats will increase (except for health).
